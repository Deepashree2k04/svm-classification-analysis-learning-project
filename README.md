This project demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for solving a classification problem. The objective was to explore how different SVM kernels perform on a structured dataset and to improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

##  Project Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
* Implement SVM for binary classification
* Compare multiple kernels (Linear, Polynomial, RBF)
* Optimize model performance using GridSearchCV
* Evaluate results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

##  Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

##  Workflow

1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Feature preparation and scaling
3. Training baseline SVM model
4. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
5. Kernel comparison and performance evaluation

##  Results

* Baseline Linear SVM achieved ~72% accuracy
* Hyperparameter tuning improved performance
* RBF kernel delivered the best results with ~78% accuracy and higher F1-score
* Findings suggest the presence of non-linear patterns in the dataset

##  Key Learnings

* Understanding SVM margin maximization
* Importance of kernel selection
* Role of hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance
* Evaluating classification models using multiple metrics

##  Project Type

This is a learning-focused machine learning project aimed at strengthening understanding of SVM algorithms and model evaluation techniques.
